# üèπ Tribal Wars Scavenge Calculator

A minimal, maintainable scavenge calculator that optimizes troop distribution for maximum resources per hour while maintaining full legal compliance with Tribal Wars rules.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Smart Optimization**: Automatically calculates optimal troop distribution across scavenge levels
- **Auto-Detection**: Detects world speed and available troops automatically  
- **Resource Breakdown**: Shows detailed wood/clay/iron gains and duration for each level
- **One-Click Population**: Fills scavenge forms with calculated troops (you still confirm manually)
- **Clean Interface**: Non-intrusive UI that appears in top-right corner
- **Legal Compliance**: One action per click, no automation, helper tool only

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Method 1: Browser Bookmark (Recommended)
1. Copy this entire line:
```javascript
javascript:$.getScript("https://wandering-pork.github.io/scavenge-calculator/scavenge-calculator.js")
```
2. Create a new bookmark in your browser
3. Paste the code as the URL
4. Navigate to your scavenge page and click the bookmark

### Method 2: Console Command
1. Go to your village scavenge page (Place ‚Üí Scavenge)
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Paste and run:
```javascript
$.getScript("https://wandering-pork.github.io/scavenge-calculator/scavenge-calculator.js")
```

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Navigate** to your village's scavenge page
2. **Run** the script using your bookmark or console
3. **Enter** how many troops you want to use for scavenging
4. **Click** "Calculate Optimal" to see recommendations
5. **Click** "Send Level X" buttons to populate each scavenge form
6. **Manually confirm** each scavenge by clicking "Start scavenging"

## ‚úÖ Legal Compliance

This tool is designed to comply with Tribal Wars rules:

- ‚úÖ **One action per click** - Calculate button and individual send buttons
- ‚úÖ **No automation** - Does not automatically start scavenges
- ‚úÖ **Helper tool only** - Provides recommendations, you make decisions
- ‚úÖ **Manual confirmation** - You must click "Start scavenging" for each level

**Important**: Always get approval from Tribal Wars support before using any third-party tools.

## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture
- **KISS Principle**: Single optimization algorithm, minimal UI
- **DRY Principle**: Centralized configuration and utilities
- **YAGNI Principle**: Only essential features included
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility modules with clear interfaces

### Algorithm
- Uses greedy optimization to maximize resources per hour
- Prioritizes high-efficiency scavenge levels
- Accounts for world speed and troop capacity constraints
- Calculates actual resource gains and duration

### Browser Support
- Works in all modern browsers
- Requires jQuery (already loaded in Tribal Wars)
- Uses ES6+ features with fallbacks

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
scavenge-calculator/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scavenge-calculator.js    # Main userscript
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html               # GitHub Pages landing page

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Script Not Loading
- Ensure you're on the scavenge page (`screen=place&mode=scavenge`)
- Check that jQuery is available (built into Tribal Wars)
- Try running in browser console first

### World Speed Not Detected
- The script will prompt you to enter world speed manually
- Check if `window.game_data.speed` is available
- Enter speed as decimal (e.g., 1.0, 1.2, 2.0)

### Troops Not Detected
- Ensure you're on the scavenge page with troops visible
- Check that `.units-entry-all` elements are present
- Refresh the page and try again

### Send Function Not Working
- Verify scavenge forms are present and not locked
- Check that form selectors match your world's HTML structure
- Ensure scavenges aren't already running
